# # Gettext Usage
#
# ## .pot files
#
#  .pot files hold your translation msgid's for Gettext
#
#  .pot entries are *extracted from source automatically*.
#  You should only add msgid entries to .pot files for dynamic
#  keys that are not compile-time literals, such as Ecto msgid's.
#  The msgstr's for .pot entries will always be blank strings.
#
# ## .po files
#
# Translations for the msgid's defined in .pot files go in the
# corresponding .po file, located in:
#
#     /priv/gettext/[locale]/LC_MESSAGES/[domain].po
#
#  where `locale` could be "en" and `domain` "default", "errors"
#
#  For .po files, you only enter the msgstr translations.
#  The msgid's are extracted and merged into the po files for you.
#
# See http://hexdocs.pm/gettext for detailed docs
