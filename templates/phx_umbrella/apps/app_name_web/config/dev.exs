# In order to use HTTPS in development, a self-signed

# Note that this task requires Erlang/OTP 20 or later.
# Run `mix help phx.gen.cert` for more information.

#       certfile: "priv/cert/selfsigned.pem"

# If desired, both `http:` and `https:` keys can be
# configured to run both http and https servers on
# different ports.<%= if html do %>
